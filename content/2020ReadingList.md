I’ve always been an avid reader and sometimes I can find it hard to remember which books I’ve already read. That’s why this year I’ve decided to compile a list of the books that I managed to finish. Hopefully, this will be an inspiration to some people to start tracking their progress and maybe to get back into reading if they’ve gotten off track. I absolutely love delving into a great book and losing myself in the plot. It’s a great way to relax and I find that it’s an incredible way to spark my imagination. You will probably notice that many of the books I post here are classics. I do most of my reading on my Kindle and I discovered that there are hundreds of classic novels on there for free. If you’re worried about getting into reading because of the price this could be a great way to save some money. The library is also a perfect choice if you love the feel of a real book.
